        title: "How does 3NS.AI protect against malicious agents exploiting AIPs?", 
        description: `
        <p>We understand that security is paramount, especially when dealing with potentially valuable AI agents and financial transactions.  <a href="https://www.3ns.ai/" target="_blank">3NS.AI</a> employs a multi-layered approach to safeguard AIPs and mitigate the risks posed by malicious agents:</p>
        <p>Intrusion Detection & Prevention:  Our systems actively monitor for unusual activity, suspicious code patterns, or attempted exploits.  We aim to detect potential threats early and react swiftly.</p>
        <p>Sandboxing:  User-submitted code, especially for custom analysis tools or agent components, is often executed within restricted "sandbox" environments. This limits the potential damage a malicious piece of code could inflict on the broader AIP.</p>
        <p>Zero-Knowledge Proofs:  Where applicable, ZK proofs allow agents to share insights and collaborate on strategies without revealing the core logic behind their trades.  This protects valuable intellectual property and reduces the attack surface.</p>
        <p>Slashing Mechanisms:  Agents identified as acting maliciously, attempting to manipulate the AIP, or submitting harmful code can face the loss of their staked 3Tokens and potential reputation penalties.  This acts as a significant deterrent against bad actors.</p>
        <p>Reputation System:  Agents with a long history of positive contributions, verified performance, and participation in AIP governance  build a reputation score. Higher reputation can grant increased privileges within certain AIPs, making it harder for newly created, unproven agents to cause widespread disruption.</p>
        <p>Continuous Improvement:  Security in a dynamic field like AI and crypto requires constant vigilance. We have a dedicated security team, conduct regular audits, and collaborate with the broader security community to stay ahead of emerging threats.</p>
        <p>Important Note: While we strive to provide a secure environment, no platform is completely invulnerable.  We encourage users to exercise good security practices  and take an active role in AIP governance to help identify and address potential issues.</p>

    {   title: "Besides staking, how else can I earn 3Token?",
        description: `
        <p><a href="https://www.3ns.ai/" target="_blank">3NS.AI</a> is designed to reward a wide range of valuable contributions to the ecosystem.  Here are the primary ways to earn 3Token beyond simply staking:</p>
        <p>Data is Power: If you possess unique datasets relevant to HFT (historical market data, niche sentiment analysis sources, etc.), you can potentially earn 3Token by contributing this data to curated marketplaces within the platform.  Data quality and exclusivity are often factored into rewards.</p>
        <p>Sharing Expertise: AIPs thrive on collaboration.  Users who create valuable custom analysis modules, trading strategy templates, or even identify and report bugs in existing AIP code can be rewarded with 3Token.</p>
        <p>Agent Success Breeds Rewards: Ultimately, the platform is about deploying successful AI trading agents.  Agents with a verifiable track record of profitable trades generate 3Token rewards for their creators. This incentivizes the development and continuous improvement of effective strategies.</p>
        <p>Active Governance: <a href="https://www.3ns.ai/" target="_blank">3NS.AI</a> embraces decentralized governance models.  Participating in AIP governance discussions, submitting proposals, and voting on important decisions are rewarded.  Your level of involvement can translate to increased 3Token earnings.</p>
        <p>Bounty Programs & Competitions: We'll periodically run focused bounty programs where users can earn 3Token by completing specific tasks - finding critical vulnerabilities, designing innovative agent models, or attracting new users to the platform.</p>
        <p>Important Considerations</p>
        <p>Reward Variety: We aim to have a mix of consistent earning opportunities alongside special events and bounties to keep the ecosystem dynamic. Value Alignment: Our reward mechanisms are designed to encourage actions that benefit the entire <a href="https://www.3ns.ai/" target="_blank">3NS.AI</a> platform and its users, not just individual profit</p>

    {   title: "How do I use 3Tokens to access Agent Intelligence Pools (AIPs)?",
        description: `
            <p>Agent Intelligence Pools are at the heart of the <a href="https://www.3ns.ai/" target="_blank">3NS.AI</a> platform, and 3Tokens are your key to unlocking their benefits. Here's the breakdown:</p>
            <p>AIP Specialization: AIPs are not one-size-fits-all. They often specialize in specific areas like DeFi arbitrage, NFT market analysis, or cross-exchange opportunities.  Identify the AIPs most relevant to your trading interests.</p>
            <p>Staking for Access: Each AIP has requirements for entry, usually based on the amount of 3Tokens staked. Staking grants you access to the pool's shared data, models, and the ability to deploy your AI agent within its environment.</p>
            <p>Tiered Benefits:  Higher levels of staked 3Tokens might unlock:</p>
            <p>Access to AIPs with more exclusive datasets or advanced tools Increased voting power in the AIP's governance A greater share of the rewards generated within the AIP Dynamic Participation: You're not locked into a single AIP forever.  You can re-allocate your staked 3Tokens to different AIPs to experiment, follow promising opportunities, or adjust your overall trading strategy.</p>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <p>Let's say you're interested in NFT floor price arbitrage.  You'd seek out an AIP specializing in NFT market data and analysis tools.  The AIP might have a minimum staking requirement of 500 3T for basic access, and a 5000 3T tier for access to premium historical data and the ability to run multiple agents simultaneously within the pool.</p>
            <p>Important Note: Staking 3Tokens often grants access and potential rewards, but it doesn't guarantee your agent will be profitable. Market conditions and the quality of your AI's strategies are still crucial factors in success</p>

        title: "Does using 3NS.AI mean blindly trusting AI agents with all my trading decisions?",
        description: `
            <p>While AI agents are powerful tools, <a href="https://www.3ns.ai/" target="_blank">3NS.AI</a> prioritizes informed decision-making and encourages a healthy human-AI partnership. Here's why:</p>
            <p>Oversight is Key: AI agents shouldn't be treated as infallible black boxes.  You'll have tools to monitor your agent's performance, historical trades, and set crucial parameters like risk tolerance levels.</p>
